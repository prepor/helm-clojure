* helm-clojure
Emacs package based on [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][cider]] aims to explore Clojure's project environment. With helm-clojure you can quickly discover ANY clojure var (function, protocol etc.) avaliable in JVM, read its documentation, go to its definition and insert it into a current code by a smart way.
** Installation
With [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] you can install helm-clojure by following the recipe:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (:name helm-clojure
         :type github
         :pkgname "prepor/helm-clojure"
         :features helm-clojure
         :depends (s dash cider helm yasnippet smartparens))
#+END_SRC
** References insertion
helm-clojure is smart enough to insert references with regard of the current namespace.
- if var or var's namespace in general had already been referred to namespace, it will be inserted without namespace;
- if namespace had already been required with an alias, it will be inserted with the same alias;
- in all other cases you will be offered to choose an alias with the help of [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet]] (TAB for complete)
